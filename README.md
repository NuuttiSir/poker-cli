# Poker CLI

## What

This is my (Very Work in progress) Poker CLI game written in GO
I hope to make this fun and interesting project that has all the ingredients for poker

## Why

I have always been intrigued by poker, playing and watching it on the web
So I wanted to try and make my own game to play on because,
as a student I don't have the funds to play anytime I want
So making this CLI game I get the dopamine hits of playing and not taking a beating on my bank account
with all the 72o busts.
As well as learning GO and programming principles on the side
